## Jets Project

* Skill Distillery Week 2 Homework

### Description
For this project, I created different types of jet airplanes with their
own characteristics. A menu is presented to the user with different
options, each representing the various things they can do with the fleet of jets, such as 
displaying the fastest jet in the fleet, having a fighter jet battle, or even creating your 
own jet and adding it to the fleet!  

### Technologies Used
* Java
* UML diagrams
* Java Objects and Classes
* String and StringBuilder

### Lessons Learned
This was the first OOP project I tackled by myself, without the help
of pair programming! I learned a lot of things about how objects interact with
each other that I hadn't previously picked up on.

It reinforced what I have been learning about encapsulation, improved my understanding
of how to call methods across different classes, and gave me a better overall foundation for OOP.
Lastly, it was interesting to see that arrays can be used for even more tasks
than I had previously realized and how for loops are made to work so well with arrays.
