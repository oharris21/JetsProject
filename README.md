## Jets Project

* Skill Distillery Week 2 Homework

### Description
For this project, I created different types of jet airplanes, each with their
own data, making them unique. A menu is presented to the user with different
options, representing the various things they can do with the fleet of jets. The
options range from something as simple as displaying the fastest jet in the fleet,
to creating your own jet and adding it to the fleet!  

### Technologies Used
* Java
* UML diagrams
* Java Objects and Classes
* String and StringBuilder

### Lessons Learned
Seeing that this was the first OOP project I tackled by myself, without the use
of pair programming, I learned a lot of things about how objects interact with
each other that I hadn't previously picked up on.

It reinforced what I have been learning about encryption, in which situations I
want certain things to be private and others public. It improved my understanding
of how to call methods across different classes, which is a critical part of OOP.
And lastly, it was interesting to see that arrays can be used for even more tasks
than I had realized.
